# Chord-cljs

A web app implemented in Clojurescript that allows to get a chord name based on pushed piano keys.

Live demo : http://chord-cljs.herokuapp.com/

## Running

Run:
lein ring server

This should open a web browser with the application. You can also go to live demo listed above.


## Using

Click on the piano keys and the chord name shows up. Chord names might not be the simplest possible (chord recognition taken from the Overtone project).
